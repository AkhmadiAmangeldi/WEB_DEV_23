            <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly <em>can’t do algebra.</em><br>
            <em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike.</em> Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
            There was a time when <em>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</em><br>
            And <em>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
            Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going.<br>
            This. is. <strong>learning.</strong><br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong>
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere</em> can understand.<br>
            Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You only have to know one thing:<br>
            <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
